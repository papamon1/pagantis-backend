## 📝 Other notes ✏️

Some of the validations could have been done in the frontend side. Format, alerts, messages and so on beign very important could make the tasks endless
and you can code tons of them so, I put some of them on the backend side.

With time, we could add JWT, encrypted password, of course testing... and some of the things that I couldn't finish.
